# ⏳ Days Till

> **Never Miss What Truly Matters!** *(or just procrastinate but with a good UI to glance upon)*

A stupidly beautiful countdown app that makes waiting for stuff actually enjoyable. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because who needs 47 frameworks to count down to the midsem youre prolly gonna fail :D
I made this while learning JavaScript

## ✨ Features(there arent much) 
- **Glassy UI** - it looked good so i added it
- **Color-Coded Progress Bars** - Green = chill, Yellow = getting close, Red = cooked 
- **Mobile Responsive** - Works on your phone
- **LocalStorage** - Your events persist even after you rage-quit the app
- **No Sign-Up** - No chinese in me so no info stealing XD
